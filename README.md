## Abstract
 A multifunctional synaptic analysis system based on several advanced deep learning models. The system achieved synapse counting in low-magnification EM images and synaptic ultrastructure analysis in high-magnification EM images. The synapse counting system based on ResNet18 and Faster R-CNN model accomplished an average precision (mAP) of 92.55%. For synaptic ultrastructure analysis, the Faster R-CNN model based on ResNet50 reached the mAP of 91.60%; the DeepLab v3+ model based on ResNet50 enabled high performance in presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane segmentation with a global accuracy of 0.9811; the Faster R-CNN model based on ResNet18 achieved the mAP of 91.41% for synaptic vesicle detection.
